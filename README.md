# claudeD — Discord-Claude Bridge

**Use Claude Code from anywhere — your phone, your tablet, your team's Discord server.**

claudeD bridges the full power of [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to Discord. Each Discord channel maps to a project directory; each thread is an isolated Claude session. Mention the bot, get a thread, and interact with Claude exactly as you would from the CLI — streaming responses, tool execution, interactive prompts, and all. Full CLI parity.

---

## Features

### 🔗 Core — Message Bridging
- **Bidirectional message bridge** — Discord messages forwarded to Claude; Claude responses streamed back
- **Streaming output** — fast responses (<3s) sent in one shot; longer responses use a live typewriter effect with a `▌` cursor, edited every ~1.2s
- **Smart message splitting** — long responses split at paragraph/line/space boundaries, never mid–code-block
- **Code fence protection** — unclosed ` ``` ` blocks are closed-and-reopened across chunk boundaries
- **File attachments** — upload files in Discord and Claude can read them (images, code, docs)
- **Thread auto-creation** — mention the bot in a bound channel → thread created automatically, named after your message

### 📁 Project Management
- **`/project bind`** — bind a Discord channel to a local project directory
- **`/project system-prompt`** — set a persistent system prompt per project
- **`/project add-dir`** — grant Claude access to additional directories
- **`/mcp add` / `add-url`** — attach MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers (stdio or HTTP)
- **`/plugin add`** — load Claude Code plugins from a directory
- **Path security** — all paths validated against a configurable root; `..` traversal and symlink escapes rejected

### 🧵 Session Management
- **`/session resume`** — resume a previous session with full conversation context
- **`/session fork`** — branch a new session from the current conversation
- **`/session compact`** — compress context to save tokens (maps to Claude's `/compact`)
- **`/session worktree`** — create a git worktree for isolated work on a branch
- **`/session interrupt`** — interrupt Claude mid-operation
- **`/session stop`** — terminate the current session
- **`/session list`** — see all active sessions across the server
- **`/session info`** — view model, turns, and cost for the current session
- **`/session security-review`** — run Claude's built-in security review
- **`/session settings`** — apply custom settings JSON to the session
- **Auto-resume** — returning to a thread automatically resumes the previous session

### 🤖 Model Control
- **`/model`** — switch Claude model (sonnet, opus, haiku, or full model ID); starts a new session
- **`/effort`** — set thinking effort level (low / medium / high / xhigh / max)
- **`/fallback-model`** — set a fallback model for when the primary is overloaded
- **`/max-turns`** — cap the number of tool-use turns per response to prevent runaway loops

### 🔧 Tool Control
- **`/tools allow`** — whitelist specific tools (e.g. `Bash Edit Read`)
- **`/tools deny`** — blacklist specific tools (e.g. `WebSearch`)
- **`/tools reset`** — restore default tool permissions
- **`/budget set`** — set a per-session spending cap (USD)

### 🎨 Display & Rich UI
- **Colored embeds** — purple for Claude, yellow for running tools, green for success, red for errors, blue for info, gray for thinking
- **Diff preview** — `Edit` / `Write` tool calls show a formatted preview in Discord
- **File upload** — large code blocks (>3000 chars) automatically uploaded as file attachments
- **Thinking spoiler** — Claude's `ThinkingBlock` output rendered as a spoiler-tagged embed
- **Plan mode** — `EnterPlanMode` / `ExitPlanMode` shown as status embeds
- **Subtask display** — `Task` tool calls rendered with description
- **Todo list** — `TodoWrite` renders a checkbox-style todo list embed
- **PreToolUse hooks** — "🔮 Preparing: ToolName…" notification appears *before* tool execution
- **Interactive prompts** — `AskUserQuestion` → Discord buttons (≤4 options) or select menus (5–25 options) with 5-minute timeout
- **Crash recovery** — error embed with a 🔄 Retry button to restart the session
- **Cost footer** — every response shows cost, tokens, turns, model, and duration

### 🤖 Custom Agents
- **`/agent create`** — define a named agent with a custom system prompt and description
- **`/agent use`** — activate an agent in the current thread
- **`/agent list`** — list all defined agents
- **`/agent delete`** — remove an agent definition
- Agents persist across bot restarts (JSON storage)

### 💰 Cost Tracking
- **`/cost show`** — per-channel cumulative cost and call count
- **`/cost total`** — global cost across all channels
- **`/cost reset`** — reset a channel's cost counter
- Per-response cost shown in the response footer
- Costs persisted to disk (survives restarts)

### 🏥 Health & Operations
- **`/health`** — uptime, active sessions, bound projects, Claude CLI version, Python version
- **`/review`** — start a PR review session (creates a thread with `--from-pr`)
- Graceful fallback if Message Content Intent is not enabled (slash commands still work)

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+**
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and authenticated — verify with `claude --version`
- **Discord bot token** from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- **Discord bot permissions:**
  - Send Messages
  - Create Public Threads
  - Manage Channels
  - Read Message History
  - Embed Links
  - Attach Files
  - Use Slash Commands
- **Message Content Intent** enabled in the bot's Developer Portal settings (Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents → Message Content Intent)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HXYerror/claudeD.git
cd claudeD
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

---

## Configuration

Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | **Yes** | — | Your Discord bot token |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | No | `sonnet` | Default Claude model (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or full model ID) |
| `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE` | No | `default` | Permission mode: `default`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`, `bypassPermissions` |
| `CLAUDED_PROJECTS_ROOT` | No | `~` (home dir) | Root directory for project bindings — paths outside this are rejected |
| `CLAUDED_ALLOW_UNBOUND_FALLBACK` | No | `false` | When `1`/`true`, `@bot` in an unbound channel falls back to `$HOME` as `cwd`. When unset/`false` (default), the message is silently ignored — run `/project bind <path>` first. ⚠️ See security warning below |

> ⚠️ **Security warning:** Setting `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE=bypassPermissions` disables all tool-permission prompts. Claude will execute shell commands and file edits without confirmation. Only use this if every Discord user with channel access is trusted with shell access on the host machine.

> ⚠️ **Security warning:** Setting `CLAUDED_ALLOW_UNBOUND_FALLBACK=1` lets *any* user with channel-write permission run Claude with `cwd=$HOME` — including reading `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, etc. Unlike `/project bind`, the fallback path is *not* validated against `CLAUDED_PROJECTS_ROOT` and *does not* require Discord administrator. Only enable if every potential message author is trusted with read access to the operator's home directory. The default (`false`) is the v1.0 behavior: unbound channels ignore `@bot`.

## Quick Start

1. **Start the bot:**
   ```bash
   clauded
   ```

2. **Invite the bot** to your Discord server using the OAuth2 URL from the Developer Portal (with the permissions listed above).

3. **Bind a channel** to a project directory:
   ```
   /project bind /path/to/your/project
   ```

4. **Mention the bot** with your request:
   ```
   @ClaudeBot refactor the auth module to use JWT tokens
   ```

5. The bot creates a thread, starts a Claude session, and streams the response. Continue the conversation in the thread — context is preserved across messages.

### Data Flow

```
User @mentions bot in #my-project channel
  → Bot creates thread "refactor the auth module..."
    → SessionManager creates ClaudeBridge(cwd=/path/to/project)
      → ClaudeSDKClient connects to Claude Code CLI
        → User messages streamed to Claude
        → Claude responses streamed back through DiscordRenderer
          → Text → typewriter messages
          → ToolUse → colored status embeds
          → AskUserQuestion → InteractionHandler → buttons/menus
          → ResultMessage → cost footer
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| **Bot doesn't respond to messages** | Enable **Message Content Intent** in Discord Developer Portal → Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents |
| **"DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN is not set"** | Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your bot token |
| **"claude not found" on session start** | Install Claude Code CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` and verify with `claude --version` |
| **Bot can't create threads** | Ensure the bot has **Create Public Threads** and **Send Messages** permissions in the channel |
| **"Path is outside the allowed projects root"** | The path must be under `CLAUDED_PROJECTS_ROOT` (defaults to `~`). Adjust the env var or use an allowed path |
| **Rate limit errors / edits failing** | This is normal under heavy load — the renderer auto-backs-off. Discord limits message edits to ~5/s |
| **Session crashes with retry button** | Click 🔄 Retry — a fresh session is created automatically. Check logs for the root cause |
| **Slash commands not appearing** | Commands sync on startup. Wait ~1 minute, or restart the bot. Guild-level sync can take up to an hour |
| **Bot starts but slash commands fail** | Make sure the bot was invited with the **Use Slash Commands** (applications.commands) scope |
| **Permission mode warnings** | If using `bypassPermissions`, ensure only trusted users can post in bound channels |
